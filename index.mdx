## What is VIJ?

VIJ consists of two main components that work together to provide comprehensive error monitoring:

### vij-sdk

A minimal, framework-agnostic SDK that automatically captures runtime errors, unhandled rejections, and custom exception logs from both **browser** and **Node.js** environments.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic error capture in browser and Node.js
- Intelligent batching and queue management
- Rich contextual metadata (browser info, viewport, network, process details)
- Configurable severity levels (error, warning, info)
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Zero dependencies (except tslib)

### vij-admin

A fullstack Next.js dashboard that serves as both the ingestion API and visualization layer.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time error monitoring dashboard
- AI-powered error analysis with Gemini
- Automatic error grouping and deduplication
- Advanced filtering and full-text search
- Analytics and trend visualization
- MongoDB storage with optimized indexes
- Self-hosted with complete data control

## Why VIJ?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete data ownership">
    VIJ is fully self-hosted. Your error data never leaves your infrastructure, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and giving you complete control over sensitive information.

  <Accordion title="Zero vendor lock-in">
    Open-source and MIT licensed. You can modify, extend, and deploy VIJ however you need without worrying about pricing tiers, API limits, or vendor restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI-powered insights">
    Built-in integration with Google Gemini provides intelligent error analysis, root cause suggestions, and automated fix recommendations — without sending data to third-party services.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developer-first design">
    Clean, intuitive interface with powerful filtering, search, and grouping. View rich stack traces, metadata cards, and contextual information exactly when you need it.

    - Supports all modern browsers
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node.js">
    - Captures uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
    - Collects process information (memory, PID, versions)
    - Works with Node.js 18+ (native fetch support)
    - Compatible with Express, Next.js, and other frameworks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    - Full type definitions included
